Example for rendering other players

- [ ] (2 point) Currently Online can only render the other players' position. Try and figure out a way to render change in direction and whether or not a player is moving or not. 

(HINT 1: Try to figure out how to change animation direction first for your player. Then figure out how to render animation for online players; maybe you can check how online manager handles it?)

(HINT 2: We've added 'HINT:...' comments, check 'em out!)

- [ ] (1 point) Chat Mechanism. Implement a chat system for the online version.
(HINT: We've added a chat_overlay.py and some additional comments in game_scene.py)
